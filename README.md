# Working on Collaborative Coding Projects with Git and GitHub
*8CC00 - Advanced Programming and Biomedical Data Analysis*

## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used in software 
development. GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git 
repositories. This practical will guide you through the basic steps of using 
Git and GitHub in a collaborative project. Within the time frame of this 
practical, we will not be able  to cover all the features of Git and GitHub. 
However, we will cover the basic features that are essential for collaborative 
projects and focus on some additional features to enhance your Git and GitHub 
usage.

## Objectives
1. Explain the advantages of using version control in collaborative projects.
2. Work with Git and GitHub to create and manage a repository for a collaborative project.
3. Use GitHub desktop to commit and push changes to a repository.
4. Use GitHub to create a pull requests and merge changes to a remote repository.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, please complete the following steps:
1. Create a GitHub Account
2. Install GitHub Desktop
